# SQA Automation with Selenium and TestNG

## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of how to use Selenium and TestNG for software quality assurance (SQA) automation. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, and TestNG is a testing framework that makes it easy to write and run test cases. Together, Selenium and TestNG provide a powerful and flexible way to automate SQA testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the tests in this project, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

Java JDK (Recommended version is 8 or 11)
Selenium WebDriver
TestNG

## Running the Tests

To run the tests in this project, you will need to do the following:

Clone the project to your local machine.
Open the project in an IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
Update the config.properties file with your Selenium WebDriver path and the URL of the website you want to test.
Right-click on the testng.xml file and select "Run As" > "TestNG Suite".

## Test Reports

The test results will be generated in the test-output folder in the project directory. The default report is in the form of an XML file, but you can also generate an HTML report by running the command: testng2html testng-results.xml.

## Conclusion

This project is a simple demonstration of how to use Selenium and TestNG for SQA automation. With a few modifications and additions, this project can be used as a solid foundation for automating SQA testing on a variety of websites and web applications.
